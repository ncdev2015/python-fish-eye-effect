# Python Fish-Eye Effect and Image Stitching

This project demonstrates how to stitch multiple images together to create a panorama and apply a fish-eye lens effect to the resulting panorama using Python. It uses OpenCV for image processing and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Features

- **Image Stitching**: Combines multiple images into a seamless panorama.
- **Fish-Eye Effect**: Applies a fish-eye lens distortion to the panorama.
- **Visualization**: Displays the original images, the stitched panorama, and the fish-eye panorama.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
